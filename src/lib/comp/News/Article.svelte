			Inspired by Ableton Live’s Resonators plugin, we have created our own harmonic resonator! In
			addition to the standard features found in Live’s utility, the
      <strong class="font-medium">Rezonator</strong>
      offers more flexibilty in terms of note input and effects.

		<p class="mb-4">
			Not only does our plugin allow you to save multiple states for easy automation between
			chords/harmonies, but you can also route MIDI directly into the
      <strong class="font-medium">Rezonator</strong>!
		</p>

			While actually using
      <strong class="font-medium">Rezonator</strong>,
      people often felt the need to process only the wet signal, to
			get rid of low-end mud with an EQ for example. As a result, the plugin comes with its own
			built in array of effects, mainly an EQ and reverb, which both only get applied to the wet
			signal.
